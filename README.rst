RFC 2119 translations
=====================

The structure of RFCs is very useful for a variety of technical documents,
specially the words for requirements levels can be used widely. RFC 2119 is
a reference for the reader of RFCs and documents structured alike. I therefore
translated it to German. Please feel free to fork and add other languages.
